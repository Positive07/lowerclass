# Performance Tests

This performance tests were taken from [Kikito's Middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass/tree/master/spec)

So that they can be reliably used to compare Lowerclass to Middleclass

## Run

Just execute the following command:

```bash
lua performance/run.lua
```

## Changes

Disabled the static attributes tests, since those are not implemented in Lowerclass
